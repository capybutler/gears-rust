//! AM-internal "system actor" `SecurityContext` factories.
//!
//! Background AM flows have no end-user `SecurityContext` to forward
//! but still need to call into cross-module clients (Resource Group,
//! `IdP` plugin) and the platform's `AuthZ` resolver. This module
//! mints the stable, audit-correlatable identity AM uses on those
//! paths: every system call carries `subject_id =
//! AM_SYSTEM_ACTOR_UUID` and `subject_type = "am.system"`, mirroring
//! the `actor=system` label AM emits in its own `am.events` audit
//! pipeline.
//!
//! # Why site-specific factories instead of one constructor
//!
//! The naïve shape — one `am_system_context(scope_tenant)` exposed
//! crate-wide — turns "system actor" into a casual primitive any
//! future contributor can reach for to bypass the request-scoped
//! `SecurityContext` contract (e.g. a REST handler that wants to
//! "just check existence" without plumbing the caller context).
//! Cross-tenant leak regressions in adjacent monorepos have started
//! exactly there.
//!
//! Routing every legitimate call through a named factory tightens the
//! seam two ways:
//!
//! 1. **Visibility audit.** The factory name is the contract: a grep
//!    for `for_retention_sweep` / `for_provisioning_reaper` / … shows
//!    every legitimate use case in O(filename) and makes "where does
//!    AM elevate to system?" trivially searchable. A new use case
//!    must add a new factory here, which is a review-magnet.
//! 2. **Construction-site observability.** Each factory emits a
//!    `tracing::info!(target: "am.system_actor", site = …, …)` line
//!    on every call. A future audit pipeline can subscribe to that
//!    target and reconcile every system-actor invocation against the
//!    legitimate-sites list; without per-site logging there is no
//!    wire signal to audit.
//!
//! Visibility is `pub(crate)` so the impl-crate boundary keeps this
//! out of the `account-management-sdk` surface; external consumers
//! drive AM through the [`AccountManagementClient`] trait and never
//! mint a system context themselves.
//!
//! # Today's call sites
//!
//! * [`for_module_init`] — RG type-schema registration from
//!   `module::init`. Platform-scoped (no tenant binding).
//! * [`for_bootstrap`] — `provision_tenant` / compensation
//!   `deprovision_tenant` on the platform root inside the bootstrap
//!   saga and its step-3 compensator.
//! * [`for_provisioning_reaper`] — `deprovision_tenant` calls from
//!   the provisioning-reaper batch on rows stuck in retry.
//! * [`for_retention_sweep`] — `deprovision_tenant` from the
//!   hard-delete retention sweep on rows past their retention window.
//! * [`for_user_cleanup`] — RG membership cleanup on `delete_user`
//!   after the `IdP` `deprovision_user` succeeds.
//! * [`for_user_groups_cascade`] — RG cascade-cleanup hook fired
//!   when a tenant is hard-deleted.
